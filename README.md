# Complex Numbers for Python
A python class for complex numbers to handle complex numbers in algebraic and polar form.

Since python natively supports complex numbers this seems rather pointless. If you wanna use complex numbers in python rather use the constructor `complex(real, imaginary)` and the cmath library.
