# Complex Numbers for Python
A python class for complex numbers.

Planned:
- Creating a documentary 
- Upgrading the unittest.py file
- Looking for a way to improve accuracy in translating between polar and algebraic form; maybe adding an epsilon feature to CN.eq()
- Adding the eq() function to CNPolar()
